PNCurrency makes it easy to interchange different currency formats within your
applicaiton. If you've ever worked with currency in your app before then you
know how common of a task it is converting between cents, double, strings or
even some formatted variant of those. That's where PNCurrency comes in, it is
a simple interface for doing just that. Read on to check out the interface and
see how to get started.

### Install
-----------

###### Cocoapods

PNCurrency is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "PNCurrency"
```

Now you can add to your project with

```objc
#import <PNCurrency/PNCurrency.h>
```

###### Source

You can clone the repo with git:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/pinnrepo/PNCurrency.git
```

then simply add the files to your project, and use a local import header

```objc
#import "PNCurrency.h"
```

### Features
------------

Here's some good reasons to use PNCurrency in your next project instead of
writing your own:

* 100% documentation coverage
* Thoroughly unit tested
* Cocoapods integration, get started quick
* Simple interface that will drop petty lines from your source

### Usage
---------

Here's the quick jist of how to get started using PNCurrency

#### Initialization

Theres a few different ways to instantiate a new PNCurrency object, here they
are to show you how to best init the object for your usage.

###### init

The plain init will default the amount to zero. Just alloc init the object like so:

```objc
PNCurrency *currency = [[PNCurrency alloc] init];
```

###### initWithCentsAmount

To create the object when you have an amount in cents use this:

```objc
// Initialize currency to a dollar
PNCurrency *currency = [[PNCurrency alloc] initWithCentsAmount:100];
```

###### initWithDoubleAmount

You might have a raw double, in which case you'll want to use this:

```objc
// Initialize currency to a dollar
PNCurrency *currency = [[PNCurrency alloc] initWithDoubleAmount:1.00];
```

###### initWithStringAmount

Finally if you have a string that represents the amount you can feed that in as well:

```objc
// Initialize currency to a dollar
PNCurrency *currency = [[PNCurrency alloc] initWithStringAmount:@"1.00"];
```

#### Setters

Theres a good chance you're going to want to update the currency value to
something else in the objects lifetime, this can be done easily a few different
ways

###### centsAmount

You can modify the amount by changing the centsAmount property:

```objc
PNCurrency *currency = [[PNCurrency alloc] init];
currency.centsAmount = 10 // value is now $0.10
```

###### setWithDoubleAmount

Or change it with a new double value:

```objc
PNCurrency *currency = [[PNCurrency alloc] init];
[currency setWithDoubleAmount:1.11] // value is now $1.11
```

###### setWithStringAmount

Finally with a  new string value:

```objc
PNCurrency *currency = [[PNCurrency alloc] init];
[currency setWithStringAmount:@"2.00"] // value is now $2.00
```

#### Getters

Nothing fancy here but safe convenient autoconversions, when you need to 
actually return the value here's what to do

###### centsAmount

You can utilize the cents amount property to get the raw amount of cents as an
unsigned integer

```objc
PNCurrency *currency = [[PNCurrency alloc] initWithStringAmount:@"1.00"];
[currency centsAmounts] // Value is 100 (you can also use currency.centsAmount
```

###### doubleAmount

Returns the amount as a double value, may be truncated for trailing zeroes

```objc
PNCurrency *currency = [[PNCurrency alloc] initWithCentsAmount:100];
[currency doubleAmount] // Value is 1.00
```

###### stringAmount

Returns the amount as a string exactly as you would expect

```objc
PNCurrency *currency = [[PNCurrency alloc] initWithCentsAmount:100];
NSLog(@"%@", [currency stringAmount]) // prints "1.00"
```

#### Formatters

Often you'll want to print this stuff to the screen so chances are you will
want something like "$1.00" as opposed to a double or amount in cents. These
are the convenience formatters.

###### formattedAmount

Simply prints the value formatted with the dollar sign right in front

```objc
PNCurrency *currency = [[PNCurrency alloc] initWithCentsAmount:100];
NSLog(@"%@", [currency formattedAmount]) // prints "$1.00"
```

###### formattedAmountWithSpace

Prints the dollar sign in front of the amount but with a space between the $
and the amount itself

```objc
PNCurrency *currency = [[PNCurrency alloc] initWithCentsAmount:100];
NSLog(@"%@", [currency formattedAmountWithSpace]) // prints "$ 1.00"
```
